In the Merchant Ivory film A Room with a View, Lucy Honeychurch, the protagonist, finds herself torn between two rivals – the romantic and highly unsuitable George Emerson, and the pompous and eligible fop Cecil Vyse. On several occasions, George is presented to us in open-necked shirts – as when he plays tennis in Lucy’s garden in a loose twill number, before kissing her. He is often shown with fairly loose or casual clothes (and indeed is shown in no clothes) – which contrasts with Cecil Vyse, who could not be more buttoned-up. Cecil’s absurdly starchy and high collars are completed with tight waistcoasts, a fob watch, and a preening pince-nez, all of which contrive to set him at odds with his environment, and put Lucy at a distance.

The costume designers for the film, Jenny Beavan and John Bright, duly won the Oscar for best costume design, although it remains unclear whether the film was garlanded for its use of costume to describe character and support the storyline, or simply for the lushness and detail of its period costuming.
indeed, there seems to be a push and pull every year in the category, between films that are notable for the cosmetic beauty of their costume design, and films where costume can be said to perform a more organic function. “For period pieces, designers conjure – and audiences watch – something foreign, unexperienced,”  fashion historian Hilary Davidson tells BBC Culture. “So costume design becomes a much more obvious and complex part of the film’s effect, and awards recognise that effort.”

The 2020 contenders

This year the nominees for the award are an unusually eclectic bunch. A big favourite must be the costume drama Little Women – whose designer, Jacqueline Durran, is a former winner for another revisionist period movie, Anna Karenina (2013). Another previous winner, Sandy Powell, is in the running for The Irishman – an interesting inclusion, since the film’s costumes are fairly unshowy and workmanlike. The clothes here are a model of functionality over style, giving a sense of the characters’ development alongside the movie’s famous ‘de-aging’ wizardry. Joker is also nominated, and again the costumes here are almost drab – but there is strong work in the way the outfits foreshadow the character’s transformation into a villain, and his final styling is nightmarishly unforgettable. A further period recreation, Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, also has a shot at the prize, with costumes that work hard to signal the end of a classic era and the beginning of a new one. Taika Waititi’s Nazi comedy Jojo Rabbit completes the category.
